Pythagora is a frontend for MPD (musicpd.org). It is written in python and Qt4.
The main goal is usability while not limiting the user in his options. It aims
to have zero configuration. Although some things just need to be set by the
user, most options are just remembered over sessions. This way there is no
hassle reconfiguring if your habits might ever change.

For some functionality Pythagora relies on PyKDE4 mainly clear buttons on text
boxes and themed icons. It should run without PyKDE4 and fall back to default
icons.

I called it Pythagora, after Pythagoras the famous mathematician who found the
relation between different tones and octaves. One could say he found the
arithmetics in music, while a computer playing music is music comming from
arithmetics. I ditched the last s to make is sound a bit better and loosen the
relation with the old Greek a bit.

Dependencies:

 * PyQT4 (>= 4.5)
 * PyKDE (optional but recommended)
 * python-mpd
 * python 2.6

I want to express my thanks to Ed Graham (txcrackers) because I used his code
from mpd-plasma (http://code.google.com/p/mpdplasma/) as a basis to start from.
