Pythagora is a frontend for MPD (musicpd.org). It is written in python and Qt4.
The main goal is usability while not limiting the user in his or her options.
It aims to have zero configuration. Although some things just need to be set by
the user, most options are just remembered over sessions. This way there is no
hassle reconfiguring if your habits might ever change.

For some functionality Pythagora relies on PyKDE4 this is mainly fot clear
buttons on text boxes and themed icons. It should run without PyKDE4 and fall
back to default icons.

Dependencies:

 * PyQT4 (>= 4.5)
 * PyKDE (optional but recommended)
 * python-mpd
 * python 2.6

I want to express my thanks to Ed Graham (txcrackers) because I used his code
from mpd-plasma (http://code.google.com/p/mpdplasma/) as a basis to start from.
